<h2>
Hello there.
</h2>

<p>	
You've stumbled upon Hikari Kai 3.0's readme-file. Are you lost or something? Click <a href="../index.php">here</a> to be returned to the index.
</p>

<p> I, Rickard Lund, would like to personally thank everyone that made this homepage a possibility.
	<ul>
		<li> Andreans Fransson, for his wonderful work on the design, and the magical file-uploader. I love you, man! :) </li>
		<li> Henrik Hugo, for his input on the database-structure. </li>
		<li> Christoffer "Piggy" Almquist, for busting our asses, and being supportive when he wanted to be. </li>
		<li> The board of 2010. Without you guys ... well, no one would appreciate our work. Kthxbai! :D </li>
	</ul>

Also, I would like to thank YOU, user. Who've actually been curious enough around this site to look for a folder named /docs. Well done, mate! ^^
</p>

<p> Hikari Kai 3.0 is based upon HookCMS. A lightweight php-development "framework" (not really, though). It's latest incarnation is on GITHub, if you want to take a look ... </p>
